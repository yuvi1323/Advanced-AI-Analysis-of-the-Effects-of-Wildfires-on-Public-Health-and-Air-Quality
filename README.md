# Advanced-AI-Analysis-of-the-Effects-of-Wildfires-on-Public-Health-and-Air-Quality
ntroduction and Motivation:
• Problem Statement: Because wildfires deteriorate air quality, they represent a serious risk to the environment and public health.
• Relevance to AI: By combining environmental, geographic, and public health data this project shows how AI may be used to forecast and control how wildfires will affect air quality.
• Current Research: Expands upon current approaches that use machine learning and remote sensing to forecast wildfires by establishing correlations with air quality data and health effect measurements.
 
Objectives
• Primary objective:
o Is to create a prediction model that can predict how wildfires may affect air quality.
o Examine the relationship between public health outcomes after wildfire occurrences and air quality.
• Anticipated Contributions:
o Give public health experts and emergency services a comprehensive tool.
o Improve public health advisories' timeliness and accuracy after wildfires.
 
Methodology
• Data Collection and Preprocessing: We will collect information from the designated Kaggle datasets which include ‘public health measurements’, ‘air quality indices’, and ‘extensive data on wildfire incidences’.
o Pandas and NumPy in Python will be used to clean, standardize, and get this data ready for analysis, ensuring accuracy and compatibility.
• Analytical Modeling:
o Machine Learning and Deep Learning: To apply conventional machine learning algorithms for initial predictions and evaluations and will utilize Scikit-Learn.
o TensorFlow or PyTorch will be utilized to create deep learning models for more intricate studies especially those involving in spatial data from wildfires.
o It will be essential to use methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze patterns and forecast the impact and spread of wildfires.
• Computer Vision:
o We'll use ‘OpenCV’ and ‘PIL’ to process and analyze satellite imagery and identify areas affected by wildfires.
o This will allow us to precisely track landscape changes and evaluate environmental hazards.
• Integration and Processing of Data:
o Analyze the connections between wildfires and air quality indices using combined datasets according to temporal and geographic criteria.
o In order to visualize our findings, we will utilize ‘Matplotlib’, ‘Seaborn’, and ‘Plotly’ to produce both static and interactive charts and graphs.
o Tableau can be used to create sophisticated interactive dashboards if necessary.
 
Anticipated Results
• Findings: A model that can forecast a decrease in air quality based on wildfire characteristics and then evaluate the public effects on health.
• Evaluation: Assess the effectiveness of models for prediction using statistical performance metrics(i.e. accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score).
